# DeFi Kingdom Clone on Avalanche

## Overview

This project is a decentralized gaming platform, built on the Avalanche blockchain, that incorporates elements of DeFi and gaming. Players can explore a virtual world, engage in battles, trade items, and earn rewards in the form of in-game tokens. Using blockchain technology, this platform ensures a transparent, decentralized, and immersive gaming experience.

## Features

- **Custom Avalanche Subnet**: The game operates on a specialized EVM subnet within the Avalanche blockchain, ensuring scalability and customization for game logic.
- **In-Game Token**: The platform uses a custom token (`Ayush`, ticker symbol `AP`), which powers in-game transactions and player rewards.
- **Player Actions**: Players can perform various actions such as registering, battling, exploring, buying items, and transferring tokens.
- **Dynamic Leaderboard**: A real-time leaderboard tracks players’ progress based on their token balances and battle outcomes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Avalanche CLI**: Required to create and configure the custom EVM subnet.
- **Metamask**: A web wallet for interacting with the custom subnet on the Avalanche network.
- **Remix IDE**: A web-based Solidity editor for writing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Setting Up Your EVM Subnet

First, configure your custom EVM subnet using the Avalanche CLI. This custom subnet will serve as the game's blockchain environment.

#### 2. Add the Subnet to Metamask

To interact with your custom subnet, manually add it to your Metamask wallet. This step is necessary for conducting transactions within the game.

#### 3. Configure Metamask for Your Subnet

Switch the active network in Metamask to the newly created custom EVM subnet to ensure all interactions are routed correctly.

#### 4. Deploy Smart Contracts via Remix

In the Remix IDE, connect your wallet via the Injected Provider option to deploy contracts directly onto your custom subnet.

#### 5. Launch the In-Game Token

Compile and deploy the `GameToken.sol` contract using Remix to create the in-game token (`Ayush`, symbol `AP`), which powers the game economy.

#### 6. Implement Core Game Contracts

Next, deploy the `MYVault.sol` contract, which governs key mechanics like player management, battles, and in-game token transactions.

#### 7. Testing and Interactions

Once the contracts are deployed, test game features such as player registration, battles, and exploration to ensure everything runs smoothly.

## Game Mechanics

### Token Functionality

- **Deposit**: Players can stake tokens to earn shares representing their stake in the game’s economy.
- **Withdraw**: Players can redeem their shares to claim tokens from the game’s token pool.

### Player Profiles

Each player’s profile is managed by smart contracts and tracks their token balance, experience, victories, explorations, and more.

### Key Features

- **Player Registration**: New players can sign up by providing a name and receiving starting attributes.
- **Battles**: Players can compete against each other to gain experience, rank up, and earn rewards.
- **Exploration**: Exploring the game world allows players to discover rewards like tokens and experience.
- **Item Purchases**: Players can use their tokens to buy items and power-ups, which enhance gameplay and strategic options.

### Leaderboard

The system includes a leaderboard that ranks players based on their total token holdings and battle success. This ranking updates dynamically as players interact with the game.
